	<p>You can gain significant benefit from opening up your business data and functionality. Web APIs allow data to be shared between applications, publicly or privately, over the internet.</p>
	<p>Today the name of the game is ‘openness’. Significant benefit can be derived from opening up your siloed business data and functionality. APIs are a great way to merge your business data or functionality with a web or mobile application, or make it available to third parties such as partners, customers or suppliers.</p>
